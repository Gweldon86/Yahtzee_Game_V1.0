# Yahtzee_Game_v1.1
The goal of this assignment was to create a Yahtzee game without looking up how other people would implement Yahtzee specific aspects.

I'm still very new to programming (maybe sometime around June 2018 when I started for my school)and haven't even scratched the surface of what these tools are capable of. Obviously, I had to look on the web to find out how to do certain things, but I really wanted to challenge myself with creating something that would take several days to finalize and would really get me thinking. This definitely did that! Everytime I thought I had something down pat, a new issue would arise or I would forget about hidden rules. It's easy to think about the rules of the game, but you also forget that you're only allowed three rolls, and you can't score twice, etc. 

Things I can probably fix:
  - I hate that I was able to loop through certain objects like my Die objects and UpperSectionScores, but I couldn't find a good way to instaniate the LowerScores. 
  - In the Score.java file, the Straight class has a method checking for a straight. It was much uglier at first, but I'm still not the happiest with my implementation, though I'm not sure a better way is around without getting super complicated. For now, this works with five dice. Twenty dice? Probably not.
  - Some of the methods on the MainActivity page that deal with rolling the dice could be combined in one, but I was focused on trying to separate concerns where possible, if I even know what that means.
  
Obviously, the visuals are VERY basic. I just wanted a working game first. Then I can work on silly stuff like textures and animations.
  
For now, I got nothing else to say, please give me feedback, I'm really happy with how this turned out. It was difficult but not mind melting.
